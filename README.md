# Regression-analysis-on-Housing-data-of-King-county-USA-

Objective of this assignment is to build Linear Regression models using Least squares, Least mean squares method and implement them on Linear regression data. Data selected for Regression Analysis is "Housing data of King county, USA". Below is the step by step process followed for building and implementation of Linear regression models.

1) Data visualization.

2) Data preprocessing.

3) Writing implementation for LinearRegress(LinearModel) - Least squares model.

4) Writing implementation for LMS(LinearModel) model.

5) Performing Preliminary test for correct implementation.

6) Dividing data into train set and test set.

7) Training train data using LinearRegress() model. Predicting target variables using use(X) method. Calculating rmse, r squared value for performance measure.

8) Training train data using LMS() model. Predicting target variables using use(X) method. Calculating rmse, r squared value for performance measure.

9) Visualization of results.

10) Analysis of algorithms.

11) Finding most and least significant features of data using OLS model of statsmodels. Performing weight analysis.

12) Eliminating least significant feature and checking for consequences.

13) Eliminating most significant feature and checking for consequences.

14) Residual plots and observation of patterns for goodness of fit.
